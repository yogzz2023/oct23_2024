Left side: System Configuration and Controls (Collapsible)
the control panel collapse and expand button is not working so check the code and make it work 
so on clicking the button it should collapase and expand when again clicked


also move this button to left side top corner instead of button 


rewrite the code for this part in such a way it works and give me the integrated code 


the data tip is not coming in the plot inside the gui so do the changes such that it works inside the gui
